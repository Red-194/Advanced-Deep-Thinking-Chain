## Features ‚ú®

- **Multi-Stage Reasoning**: Sequential analysis through research, critique, and creative synthesis
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized performance with async execution for independent thinking stages
- **Interactive Interface**: Command-line interface with multiple thinking modes
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for various HuggingFace models with automatic optimization
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support with 4-bit quantization for efficient inference
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time response generation with customizable parameters
- **Conversation Memory**: Context-aware follow-up conversations

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The system implements a five-stage thinking process:

1. **Analysis**: Systematic breakdown of the question into key concepts and sub-questions
2. **Research**: Multi-perspective exploration of the topic with historical context
3. **Critique**: Critical evaluation of assumptions, evidence, and limitations
4. **Creative**: Generation of novel insights, connections, and alternative solutions
5. **Synthesis**: Integration of all stages into a comprehensive, nuanced answer

## Installation üì¶

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-deep-thinking-chain.git
cd advanced-deep-thinking-chain

# Install dependencies
pip install torch transformers langchain langchain-community
pip install bitsandbytes accelerate  # For GPU acceleration
```

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- LangChain
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Usage üöÄ

### Basic Usage

```python
from advanced_thinking import AdvancedDeepThinkingChain, Config
import asyncio

# Initialize with default configuration
config = Config()
system = AdvancedDeepThinkingChain(config)

# Deep thinking process
async def example():
    thought_process = await system.think_deeply("What are the implications of artificial intelligence on society?")
    print(thought_process.stages[-1].content)  # Access synthesis
    
asyncio.run(example())
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python advanced_thinking.py
```

The interactive interface provides three modes:
- **Deep Mode**: Full multi-stage analysis
- **Quick Mode**: Fast, direct responses
- **Follow Mode**: Context-aware conversation

### Configuration Options

```python
config = Config(
    model_name="microsoft/phi-2",  # HuggingFace model
    temperature=0.7,               # Response creativity
    max_length=1024,               # Maximum output length
    use_gpu=True,                  # GPU acceleration
    quantize=True,                 # 4-bit quantization
    streaming=True,                # Real-time output
    max_concurrent=2               # Parallel processing limit
)
```

## Supported Models ü§ñ

- **microsoft/phi-2** (2.7B) - Balanced performance and quality
- **TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0** (1.1B) - Fast inference
- **google/gemma-2b-it** (2B) - High-quality responses
- **Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat** (0.5B) - Ultra-fast processing
- Custom HuggingFace models

## Performance Optimizations ‚ö°

- **Quantization**: 4-bit quantization reduces memory usage by ~75%
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent thinking stages run concurrently
- **Device Optimization**: Automatic GPU detection and memory management
- **Streaming**: Real-time output generation for better user experience

## Examples üí°

### Deep Analysis Example

```python
question = "How does climate change affect global food security?"
thought = await system.think_deeply(question)

# Access individual stages
analysis = thought.stages[0].content    # Initial analysis
research = thought.stages[1].content    # Research findings
critique = thought.stages[2].content    # Critical evaluation
creative = thought.stages[3].content    # Creative insights
synthesis = thought.stages[4].content   # Final synthesis
```

### Quick Response Example

```python
response = await system.quick_think("Explain quantum computing briefly")
print(response)
```
